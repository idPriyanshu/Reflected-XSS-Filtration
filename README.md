# Reflected XSS Filtration  

A Python-based project aimed at detecting **reflected XSS vulnerabilities** in websites. This project includes tools for crawling websites, generating and testing payloads, and analyzing results for vulnerability detection.  

---

## 🔍 **Project Overview**  

This project is designed to:  
1. Crawl website domains to identify **vulnerable endpoints**.  
2. Generate optimized payloads for testing reflected XSS vulnerabilities.  
3. Execute payloads and analyze responses to detect vulnerabilities. 

---

## 🛠️ **Features**  

- **Website Crawling**: Extract HTML code, methods (GET, POST, etc.), and potential vulnerable endpoints.  
- **Payload Generation**: Create optimized payloads from predefined patterns.  
- **Payload Execution**: Send requests with crafted payloads to test for vulnerabilities.  
- **Result Analysis**: Detect and log reflected XSS vulnerabilities.  
- **Output Files**: Store results in structured files for easy review.  

---

## ⚙️ **Usage**  

### 1️⃣ Run the Crawler  
Extract website data and identify potential vulnerabilities:  
```bash
python Crawler.py
```  
- **Input**: URL of the target website.  
- **Output**:  
  - HTML files stored in the `html_files/` directory.  
  - Method and URL data in `url.txt` and `url_data.json`.  

### 2️⃣ Execute Request Collection  
Collect and log all request types:  
```bash
python RequestCrawl.py
```  
- **Output**:  
  - Collected requests in `request.txt` and `request.json`.  

### 3️⃣ Generate Payloads  
Create multiple payloads for testing:  
```bash
python payload_generation.py
```  
- **Output**: Payloads saved in `payloads.txt`.  

### 4️⃣ Execute Payloads  
Test the generated payloads on the identified endpoints:  
```bash
python Payload_exec.py
```  
- **Output**: Responses logged in `result.txt`.  

### 5️⃣ Analyze Results  
Identify vulnerabilities based on payload responses:  
```bash
python Payload_exec_analyzer.py
```  
- **Output**: Vulnerability analysis stored in `analysis_results.txt`.

## 📄 **Project Structure**  

- **`Crawler.py`**: Crawls the target website, extracts HTML, and identifies endpoints.  
- **`RequestCrawl.py`**: Collects and logs request types and responses.  
- **`payload_generation.py`**: Generates payloads for testing.  
- **`Payload_exec.py`**: Executes payloads against identified endpoints.  
- **`Payload_exec_analyzer.py`**: Analyzes responses to detect vulnerabilities.  
- **Output Directories and Files**:  
  - `html_files/`: Stores HTML codes from crawled pages.  
  - `url.txt`, `url_data.json`: Stores crawled URL and method data.  
  - `request.txt`, `request.json`: Logs collected request information.  
  - `payloads.txt`: Stores generated payloads.  
  - `result.txt`: Logs payload execution responses.  
  - `analysis_results.txt`: Stores analysis results for vulnerabilities.

## 🚀 **Future Enhancements**  

1. **Machine Learning Integration**:  
   - Use ML models to analyze patterns in endpoints and responses.  
   - Automate advanced payload generation based on detected vulnerabilities.  

2. **Enhanced Detection**:  
   - Implement algorithms to identify hidden or nested vulnerabilities.  
   - Add support for detecting DOM-based XSS vulnerabilities.  

3. **Visualization**:  
   - Create dashboards for visualizing results and payload efficacy.
